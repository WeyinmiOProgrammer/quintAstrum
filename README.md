# A project I am working on:
 # Do not expect it to be anything great as I am a huge rookie and am not entirely used to working with git
 # The artwork for this project is amazing - not up for debate
 # I am probably misusing the README...
#
 #
# The project in question:
 # Is a roleplaying video game
 # with a basic story and poor graphics
 # Play as Geruo, meet some bizarre figures and face insane foes. Explore distant planets.
 # Save the galaxy...or let is burn - the choice is yours
